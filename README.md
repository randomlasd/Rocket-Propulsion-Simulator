# 🚀 Rocket Propulsion Simulator

A Python-based rocket propulsion simulator that models how rockets accelerate based on thrust, mass, fuel burn rate, and exhaust velocity. This project helps visualize the physics behind rocket motion using real equations from classical mechanics.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I’ve always loved space and rocket engineering, so I built this to understand how thrust, mass, and fuel interact to affect acceleration and velocity over time. It’s a great way to learn physics through code.

## 🎮 Features

- Simulates rocket acceleration and velocity over time
- Models changing mass due to fuel consumption
- Uses realistic equations from classical mechanics
- Visual plots of velocity and acceleration
- Console outputs for quick feedback

How It Works
Uses the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:
Δv = ve * ln(m0 / mf)

Computes thrust force with:
F = ṁ * ve
(mass flow rate × exhaust velocity)

Simulates fuel consumption over time

Visualizes motion with plots (Matplotlib)
